# FitView

Check it out at https://kylejlin.github.io/fitview!

A simple PWA to view your `.fit` files. In theory, this app could be an alternative to Garmin Connect's frontend, but it is a lot less convenient because you have to upload your file every time you want to view it (as opposed to Garmin Connect, which has a backend that stores all your files in the cloud).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
